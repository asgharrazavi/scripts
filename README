Hello World!
This is a scripts library of Voelz Lab.

Our group uses the tools of statistical mechanics and molecular simulation to investigate the structure, dynamics and energetics of biomolecules. Our goal is to devise new computational methods to design folding and binding properties of proteins and peptide mimetics from first principles.
